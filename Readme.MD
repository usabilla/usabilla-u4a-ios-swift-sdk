# Usabilla for Apps - iOS SDK
Usabilla for Apps allows you to collect feedback from your user with great ease and flexibility.

Take a look at our [Wiki](https://github.com/usabilla/usabilla-u4a-ios-sdk/wiki) for a complete and in depth guide on how to install and customize the SDK.

## Latest changes in v3.6.0

#### Added
- New delegate method called `formWillClose`, that will be called when the form needs to be dismissed (see documentation for more info)

#### Updated
- Delegate method `formDidClose` will now be called only after the form has actually been closed
- Delegate methods `formWillClose` and `formDidClose` now have an extra parameter, called `isRedirectToAppStoreEnabled`, that will reflect the app store redirection toggle present in the web interface

#### Removed
- The redirect to the app store feature has been removed to be in accordance with Apple's new guidelines on rating and reviews

#### Fixed
- Wrong delegate method being called when a form failed loading
- Error label being incorrectly placed behind the slider

## Requirements

- iOS 9.0+
- Xcode 8.0+
- Swift 3.1+

For older versions of iOS you can use v2.3.0 of the SDK.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

The Usabilla SDK is available on [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). You can install cocoapods the following way:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To use the SDK in your project, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '9.0'
use_frameworks!

target 'MyApp' do
    pod 'UsabillaFeedbackForm', '~> 3.6.0'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Carthage

The Usabilla SDK is also available through [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage).

Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#adding-frameworks-to-an-application)
to add carthage to your project.

And add this line to your `Cartfile`:

```yaml
github "usabilla/usabilla-u4a-ios-swift-sdk" "v3.6.0"
```

### Manual

Alternatively you can download the latest version of the repository and add **UsabillaFeedbackForm.framework** to your appâ€™s embedded frameworks.

## How to get started

### On the web
- Create a new form on your [Usabilla](https://app.usabilla.com/member/) Live for Apps section.
- Copy the Form ID of the form you just created and use it to open it in the SDK.


### In the SDK

#### Initialization

Inside your **AppDelegate** add the following line at the top of your file to import the sdk.

```swift
import UsabillaFeedbackForm
```

Add the following line to the **didFinishLaunchingWithOptions**:
```swift
UsabillaFeedbackForm.load()
```
The **load** method is here in order to init the caching feature, that will submit any previously unsubmitted feedback.

#### Using forms


The SDK uses the Form ID you previously got from [Usabilla](https://app.usabilla.com/member/) to fetch and display your form inside your app.

A basic implementation of the SDK would be the following.

```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController, UsabillaFeedbackFormDelegate {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        UsabillaFeedbackForm.delegate = self
        UsabillaFeedbackForm.loadFeedbackForm("Form ID")
    }

    //Called when your form succesfully load
    func formLoadedCorrectly(_ form: UINavigationController, active: Bool) {
        present(form, animated: true, completion: nil)
    }
    //Called when your forms can not be loaded. Returns a default form
    func formFailedLoading(_ backupForm: UINavigationController) {
        present(backupForm, animated: true, completion: nil)
    }

}
```

## Usage

### Adding a screenshot

It is possible to attach a screenshot to a feedback form.

You can take a screenshot at any moment calling `let image = UsabillaFeedbackForm.takeScreenshot(self.view)`.

To attach the screenshot to the form, pass it as a parameter when calling `UsabillaFeedbackForm.loadFeedbackForm("Form Id", screenshot: image)`

Pass `nil` as the `screenshot` parameter if you don't want to have a screenshot of the current view.

**Custom Screenshot & Sensitive Informations**

Instead of taking the screenshot using the `UsabillaFeedbackForm.takeScreenshot()` method, you can provide any image you wish by passing it as the `image` parameter when calling `UsabillaFeedbackForm.loadFeedbackForm()`

This will allow you to hide any user sensitive or private information by, for example, taking the screenshot yourself, removing all unwanted information and submitting the censored version.

### Adding custom variables

You can pass along custom variables that will be attached to the feedback users send.
Custom variables are held in a dictionary.

After you have initialised your controller, you can easily set custom variables using
```
var customVariables: [String : Any] = [:]
customVariables["user"] = "Mario"
customVariables["age"] = 10
```

You can create one beforehand or on the fly, as shown in the example, and its content will be reported and displayed in the Usabilla web interface.

To make sure the variables are properly displayed in the web interface it is advised to keep the dictionary object fairly simple and to not nest more than one object into another.

Custom variables are added as a parameter when calling `UsabillaFeedbackForm.loadFeedbackForm("Form ID", screenshot: nil, customVariables: customVariables)
`

### Preloading a form
If you know you will need to display a feedback form when the user is offline, you can preload it a cache it in the SDK to make it available at any given moment.   
To preload a form use
```
UsabillaFeedbackForm.preloadForms(withIds: ["myId", "myOtherId"])
```
This will fetch the latest version of the form and cache it in the SDK.    
 When you will request that form, if there is no network connectivity, the SDK will use the cached version and your user will be able to submit his feedback

Feedback submitted while offline will be sent when connectivity is restored.

If you wish, you can empty the cache using
```
UsabillaFeedbackForm.removeCachedForms()
```


### Customising the form

You can customise the colors of all elements of the form.
For a more in depth guide on customisation see the [Wiki page](https://github.com/usabilla/usabilla-u4a-ios-swift-sdk/wiki/Changing-colors)


### App Store rating
 **The original implementation has been removed in version 3.5.0 in order to follow Apple's new rating guidelines.    
From version 3.5.0 onwards we offer support for using [Apple's own rating API](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/ratings-and-reviews/)**    

To decide whether or not to prompt the user for a rating, you can read the information regarding the user's activity passed in the [Submission callback](#submission-callback)

In the Usabilla web interface it is possible to define whether a specific feedback form should prompt the user for a rating.

### Submission callback

Since **v3.3.0** it is possible to get information about the feedback the user has left by implementing UsabillaFeedbackFormDelegate.**formDidClose** method.

You will also be notified if the user has left the form without submitting it.

This method provides you with an array of **FeedbackResult**:

```swift
struct FeedbackResult {
    let rating: Int?
    let abandonedPageIndex: Int?
    var sent: Bool
}
```

This is because the user may submit the form multiple times and this method will be called only once for all feedback sent.

The **rating** value is set as soon as the user interacts with it and will be reported even if the form is not submitted.

The **abandonedPageIndex** is only set if the user cancels the form before submission.

Here is a sample implementation :

```swift
func formDidClose(_ form: UINavigationController, formID: String, with feedbackResults: [FeedbackResult], isRedirectToAppStoreEnabled: Bool){
     guard let feedback = feedbackResults.first else {
         return
     }

     if feedback.sent == false {
         let abandonedPageIndex = feedback.abandonedPageIndex
         print("Hey why did you left the form here \(abandonedPageIndex)")
         return
     }

     if let rating = feedback.rating {
         if rating >= 4 && isRedirectToAppStoreEnabled {
             // Prompt the user for rating and review
         }
     }
 }
```

### Handle manual dismiss

Since **v3.3.0** it is possible to customize the way the form is dismissed

Set the automatic UsabillaFeedbackForm dismissal attribute to false:

```swift
UsabillaFeedbackForm.dismissAutomatically = false
```

and implement the **formWillClose** delegate method:

```swift
func formWillClose(_ form: UINavigationController, formID: String, with feedbackResults: [FeedbackResult], isRedirectToAppStoreEnabled: Bool) {
    // handle your custom dismiss e.g: dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
}
```

**Warning**: by doing this the form will not dismiss by itself and you will be the only one responsible for its correct behaviour. Also, the delegate method `formDidClose` will not be called.


## Integration with Obj-C applications

To integrate the SDK in your Obj-C application, follow apple official guidelines on how to [use Swift and Objective-C in the Same Project](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/MixandMatch.html)

A quick way to approach this problem is to create a Swift file from where you will handle your application. After creating the new file and having set up the Bridging Header, you can extend your exsisting view controllers inside the Swift class to seamlessy integrate the SDK in your app.

In this example you can see a ViewController in Obj-C:

```objectivec
#import "ViewController.h"

//Remember to import the auto generated Swift header, otherwise you won't see you Swift extension
#import "objctest-Swift.h"


@interface ViewController ()

@end

@implementation ViewController


- (IBAction)buttonPressed:(id)sender {
      [self  showForm];

}


@end

```

And its Swift extension, implementing the SDK:

```swift
import UsabillaFeedbackForm

extension ViewController : UsabillaFeedbackFormDelegate {

    open override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        UsabillaFeedbackForm.delegate = self
    }


    public func formLoadedCorrectly(_ form: UINavigationController, active: Bool) {
        present(form, animated:  true)
    }

    public func formFailedLoading(_ backupForm: UINavigationController) {

    }

    @objc public func showForm(){
        UsabillaFeedbackForm.loadFeedbackForm("Form ID")
    }
}

```
